To see all hidden files in folder type,   ls-a   .
if in hidden files it shows a git file that means this file is present in github.

Type,   git status    to check if files are commited or not .
When we check git status, it give us 4 type of files,
1: Untracked Files: New files that git don't know yet.

2: to commit files.

To add file:  git add 'file name'
To commit file:  git commit -m "Some Message"
